# Dear Laura 

Hi there. I hope that this letter finds you well. I wanted to write one extra thing to let you know just how much I love you. That's all. Thank you, and good bye. I hope to see you soon .

Never forget how much I love you no matter the distance or toughness of the waters. I'm always cheering you on 100% every day 24/7 365 days a year for all eternity. I love you lil papi!
