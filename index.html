            <h3>Hi there, Laura!</h3>
            <p>
                Happy Birthday!

                I know this took a little longer than anticipated but I've been working on filling the page with all kinds of silly and fun things that we've shared together and that I know you love.
                <br>
                <br>
                You're 24! And what's more is that we've shared 5 years together. You already know this, I say it to you all the time. And its because I really am so happy that here, 5 years later I get
                to spend each and every day with you. I know that the distance has been tough, but see you on Facetime, talking to you during lunch, and even falling asleep next to you, in addition to all
                the amazing trips we've been on, truly makes me brim with happiness and excitement. You have an amazing ability to make those around you feel seen and appreciated, and I love being able to 
                watch you from afar as you get excited about little small things here and there. Oranges sitting on fire hydrants, an old man eating his ice cream, these random moments you fin such joy in remind me
                about all the wonders you can find in everyday life. Being around you inspires me to see the world with new eyes, and I mean it when I say that your gentleness, resilience, and kindness inspires me 
                every day. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This is going to be a great year for you, after all you've taken on some of the most insane challenges over the last 6 months, there's truly nothing you can't take on. If there's anything I've learned 
                about you is that you're one of the most hardworking, determined, and strong people I know. You take on challenges without complain and honestly Laura, you look unstoppable when you're out to get something done.
                That's how I know that this year you're going to make incredible things happen not just in your career, but in your life as well. May this be the year we come closer together, and may it be a year where your wildest dreams
                come true. I know I'll be right there waving my foam finger <strong>high</strong> all for you. I love you so much, Laura. Thank you for continuing to be in my life, and for making every single day an endless joy. I can't wait 
                to see you soon, and to give you a big big HUG. For now though, I hope you enjoy this lil website. Try clicking and dragging around. I hope you like the photos as well :)

                I love you! Happy Birthday, Anniversary, Bean Papi Day!
                I love you I love you!
